# Fishnet Object Detection
Module Project 1: AIPI 540 - Using deep learning methods to classify and bound fish in images of commerical fishing scenes.

![Example Image](data/test_image_2.jpg)

This project aims to leverage computer vision techniques to detect fish species and humans on commerical fishing vessels, utilizing a fine-tuned Faster R-CNN model for accurate object detection. By identifying different species and human activities, the system seeks to promote sustainable fishing practices and ensure regulatory compliance. The initiative represents a critical step towards leveraging AI in environmental conservation, offering a scalable solution to monitor and manage fishing activities effectively.
